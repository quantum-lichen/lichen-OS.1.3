🌱 Lichen OS — Foundations for Self-Organizing Cognitive Systems

Status: Research & Experimental
Focus: Data formats, resilience, cognitive alignment, systems architecture

🌟 Overview

Lichen OS is an experimental cognitive systems architecture exploring how data structure, error correction, and coherence metrics can improve the robustness and alignment of future AI systems.

Rather than optimizing for human-facing software, Lichen OS focuses on machine-native representations designed to:

detect non-legitimate state changes,

preserve contextual integrity,

and reduce systemic drift under stress.

🔑 Core Concepts
FC-496 — Fixed-Structure Cognitive Data Cells

FC-496 is a 496-bit fixed-size data cell where:

All bits are structurally allocated

No bit is informationally neutral

Any modification propagates measurable changes across the cell

This design means that unauthorized or incoherent modifications cannot be injected silently — changes are detectable, even when partially corrected.

⚠️ FC-496 does not claim to make fraud impossible.
It aims to make illegitimate changes non-transparent and observable.

Key features:

Fixed-size atomic cells (496 bits)

Parallel BCH(31,16) error correction

Structural coupling between metadata and payload

Designed for stress and corruption detection, not secrecy

UICT — Unified Information Compression Theory (Research)

UICT explores the hypothesis that information compression and physical structure are linked.

Within Lichen OS, UICT is treated as:

a modeling framework, not a physical law

a way to reason about coherence, redundancy, and stability

UICT components are isolated and optional, allowing independent evaluation.

CEML — Cognitive Entropy Minimization Law (Metric)

CEML defines a ratio-based metric:

CEML
(
Ψ
)
=
𝐶
(
Ψ
)
𝐻
(
Ψ
)
+
𝜖
CEML(Ψ)=
H(Ψ)+ϵ
C(Ψ)
	​


Used experimentally to:

detect incoherent system states

flag low-signal or unstable outputs

act as a filter, not a guarantee

CEML does not prevent errors — it helps identify conditions where errors are more likely.

H-Scale — Harmonic Evaluation Metric

H-Scale combines multiple dimensions:

coherence

efficiency

resonance

durability

It is intended as:

a decision-support signal

not a moral authority

not an enforcement mechanism

The architecture is designed to separate theory from implementation, allowing individual components to be validated or replaced independently.

🧪 Testing & Validation
Stress & Corruption Testing

Lichen OS emphasizes failure behavior, not just success cases.

Tested scenarios include:

1M+ valid FC-496 cells

Random 1–3 bit corruptions

Network interruption simulations

Sustained CPU and memory pressure

Observed results:

High detection rate of corrupted cells

Graceful degradation under load

No silent data acceptance during corruption

These results indicate robustness, not perfection.

💡 Intended Use Cases (Exploratory)

Lichen OS is not production-ready, but may be useful for research in:

resilient data storage

distributed sensing

AI system alignment metrics

long-lived autonomous systems

Claims are limited to controlled experimental contexts.

📌 Project Philosophy

Detectability over denial

Structure over heuristics

Metrics over intuition

Resilience over optimization

Lichen OS does not attempt to “solve AI ethics” or “replace existing operating systems.”
It explores how far structure alone can go in reducing ambiguity and silent failure.
